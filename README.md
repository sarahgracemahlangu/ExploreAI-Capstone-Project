# ExploreAI-Capstone-Project

This project focuses on building a time series forecasting model to predict future trends in the world’s forest area, based on historical data. The primary goal is to forecast changes in both the total forest area (in square kilometers) and the percentage of land area covered by forests. This information can help policymakers, environmental organizations, and researchers understand future patterns of deforestation or afforestation and take proactive measures to protect the world’s forests. The significance of this project lies in its potential to provide insights into global forest trends, which are crucial for environmental Conservation, policy and regulation, sustainability and research.

Forests play a critical role in maintaining ecological balance, supporting biodiversity, and combating climate change through carbon sequestration. Over the years, the global forest area has been influenced by a variety of factors, including urbanization, agriculture, industrialization, and government policies on deforestation and afforestation. Understanding the trends and predicting future changes in forest area is key to addressing environmental challenges like climate change, habitat loss, and sustainability. The forest area dataset, which includes metrics on forest areasin square kilometers for different countries, offers an opportunity to analyze these trends over time and forecast future developments.

This project will seek to answer the following questions:

What is the future trajectory of the global forest area (in both km² and %) over the next years or decades?
How have different regions or countries contributed to the changes in forest area, and can we predict future patterns?
By accurately forecasting the future of the world's forest areas, this project will contribute to more informed decision-making around sustainability and conservation.
